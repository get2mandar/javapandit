## Java SE 8 Features - Illustrated
Java SE 8 with its latest updates, most of the features are listed below:


### Lambda Expression Support in APIs
A Lambda expression (or function) is an Anonymous Function, i.e., A Function without any Name or Identifier, and with a list of formal Parameters and a Body.
An arrow (->) is used to separate the list of parameters and the body.
Multiple Examples available in source code as, Operator Custom Functional Interface and Thread example as well as Iterate over List.

### Stream API
A Stream in Java can be defined as a sequence of elements from a source. The source of elements here refers to a Collection or Array that provides data to the Stream.<br>
A Collection is an in-memory data structure that holds all the data structure's values. Every element in the Collection has to be computed before it can be added to the Collection.
While a Stream is conceptually a pipeline in which elements are computed on demand.
Multiple Examples available in source code as, Creating Streams, Parallel Streams, Stream Operations and Stream Collectors.

### Functional Interface and Default Methods
A functional interface in Java is an interface that contains only a single abstract (unimplemented) method. This can also contain default and static methods which do have an implementation, in addition to the single unimplemented method.
`Runnable`, `ActionListener`, and `Comparable` are some of the examples of Functional Interfaces.
Multiple Examples of Functional Interfaces available in source code as, Consumer Interface, Predicate Interface, Function Interface and Supplier Interface.
Also Examples of Default Methods available in source code as, Simple Default Method, Static Method in Interface and Default Method Override.

### Optionals
