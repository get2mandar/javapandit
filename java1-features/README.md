Java Program Examples for JDK 1 Features - Release Oak - Release Date: 23-January-1996

The initial release of Java originally called Oak, this had very unstable APIs and one Java Web Browser named WebRunner.
First Stable JDK version was 1.0.2, was also called as Java 1.

On 19-February-1997, with JDK 1.1 released, was having a list of features as below:
- AWT Event Model
- Inner classes
- JavaBeans
- JDBC
- RMI
- Reflection (only supported Introspection, no modification at runtime)
- JIT (Just In Time) Compiler for Windows

## Java 1 Features - Illustrated
Java 1 with its latest updates, most of the features are listed below:

### AWT Event Model
Examples with basic AWT GUI creation Code, as well as Window Closing Event handling.
Also have examples with Event Model for Component Controls and Event Delegation by extending `ActionListener` Interface.

### Inner classes
Various ways in which the inner classes can be created. Examples are available for all below wasy mentioned.

- Anonymous Inner Class As a Subclass
- Anonymous Inner Class As an Implementer of Interface
- Method Local Inner Class
- Nested Inner Class
- Static Nested Class

### Java Bean
Simple Java Bean Example and explained what are characteristics required in a Java class, to be perceive as Java Bean.

### JDBC
Simple Connection with the RDBMS Database (Microsoft SQL used here in this example), to connect to a Database already created and fetch data from a Table.

### RMI
To demonstrate Remote Method Invocation (RMI) feature in Java, Remote Interface is created as medium of communication between Server and Clint Processes.
Very basic and Simple example using `UnicastRemoteObject` RMI Server and RMI Client Operations to send message to server and receive a response back.

### Reflection (only Introspection)
Introspect Java Classes using Reflection APIs provided by Java 1, and find various properties of Java Objects created such as Access Modifier, Methods, Constructors and Fields etc.

### JIT (Just In Time) Compiler for Windows
There is no specific code example available to demonstrate JIT. But when in future, if found that can be added here as an example.
